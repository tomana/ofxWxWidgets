Only tested on Ubuntu 13.04. Compiled with -fpermissive, but this is probably avoidable.




INSTALLATION:
============

Install wxWidgets-2.9.5 or newer, and compile it with opengl. (As far as I know, the repository package does not include gl support.)
Some guidance is available here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14138/enabling-opengl-in-wxwidgets

Make sure the config.make points to the correct libraries. Check 'wx-config --libs --gl-libs'

And lastly, thank github.com/clinthidinger for his hard work.
